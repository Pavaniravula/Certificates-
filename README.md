# AI-Based Video Dubbing - Project Documentation
# Overview
This project is a Multilingual AI Video Dubbing Web Application that automates the process of dubbing videos into multiple languages using speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech synthesis. Built with Python and Flask, the app enables users to upload a video, convert the spoken language to text, translate it into a target language, and generate a dubbed version of the video with the new voiceover.
# Key Features
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR) from input video
- Language detection and translation
- AI-generated voice dubbing using TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Multilingual support (e.g., English, Hindi, Telugu, etc.)
- Web-based interface for easy access

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual Environment 
- Stable Internet Connection
# Installation
- Clone the Repository
-  git clone <https://github.com/your-username/video-dubbing-ai.git>
- cd video-dubbing-ai
- Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
- python -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
- Install Dependencies
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the Application
- python run.py
# Usage
To use the AI-based video dubbing application, first launch the Flask server by running `python run.py` in your terminal. Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). Through the web interface, you can upload a video, automatically detect and transcribe the speech, translate it into the desired language, and generate a dubbed version of the video using AI.
