# AI-Based Video Dubbing - Project Documentation
## Overview
This project is a Multilingual AI Video Dubbing Web Application that automates the process of dubbing videos into multiple languages using speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech synthesis. Built with Python and Flask, the app enables users to upload a video, convert the spoken language to text, translate it into a target language, and generate a dubbed version of the video with the new voiceover.

## Key Features:

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) from input video

Language detection and translation

AI-generated voice dubbing using TTS (Text-to-Speech)

Multilingual support (e.g., English, Hindi, Telugu, etc.)

Web-based interface for easy access
